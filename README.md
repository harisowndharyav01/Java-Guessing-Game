## Introduction

This project is a simple Java implementation of a number guessing game. It was created as part of my learning journey in Java programming. The game randomly generates a number within a specified range, and the player has a limited number of attempts to guess the correct number.

## Features

- Generates a random number within a specified range
- Allows the player to input their guesses
- Provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct
- Keeps track of the player's score
- Supports replay functionality

## Usage

To play the game, simply compile and run the `NumberGuessingGame.java` file. Follow the prompts to input your guesses and enjoy the game!

```bash
javac NumberGuessingGame.java
java NumberGuessingGame
```

## How it Works
The program utilizes the Scanner class to read input from the user and the Random class to generate random numbers. It employs loops and conditional statements to manage the game flow, validate user input, and provide feedback to the player.

For a detailed explanation of how the code works, please refer to the comments within the NumberGuessingGame.java file.
